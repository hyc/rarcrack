This is a quick'n'dirty program for cracking password-protected RAR archives. It
uses libunrar, so you need that library. If you don't have it you can fetch
it from http://www.rarlab.com/rar_add.htm

This code may be freely used by anyone as long as you don't claim you wrote it.

This is a simpler/faster version of the program at http://rarcrack.sourceforge.net/
The program expects to read candidate passwords on stdin. The most obvious way
to use it is with a program like JohnTheRipper generating passwords, and feeding
them in, like so:

john --wordlist=rockyou.txt --rules --stdout | rarcrack crypted.rar

Compile the program as:
	gcc -O2 -o rarcrack rarcrack.c -lunrar

If you get an error about "dll.hpp" missing you'll have to grab that file from
the unrar source code. You can get it at rarlab.com if all else fails.


Note that this program is already obsolete; if you have John the Ripper with
the Jumbo patch (1.7.9-jumbo-7) then you can just use rar2john instead of this
code.
